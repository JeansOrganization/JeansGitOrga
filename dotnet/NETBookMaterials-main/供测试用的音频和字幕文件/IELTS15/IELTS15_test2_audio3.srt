Part 3

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,500
You will hear two students of English called Cathy and Graham.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,800
Planning a display on 19th century British life and literature for university event.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,850
First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 24.

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,830
Now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 24.

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,860
OK, Graham. So let's check we both know what we're supposed to be doing. OK!

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:00,040
So for the universities open day, we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid 19th century.

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,240
That's right, but will have some people to help us find the materials and set it up, remember?

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,530
For the moment we just need to plan it. Good.

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,820
So have you gathered who's expected to come and see the display?

11
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:19,760
Is it for the people studying English or students from other department's? I'm not clear about it. Nor me!

12
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:29,780
That was how it used to be, but it didn't attract many people, so this year it's going to be part of an open day to raise the universities profile.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,430
It'll be publicized in the city to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,280
And it's included in the information that sent to people who are considering applying to study here next year.

15
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,170
Presumably some current students and lecturers will come. I would imagine so.

16
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,260
But we've been told to concentrate on the other categories of people, right?

17
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,740
We don't have to cover the whole range of 19th century literature, do we? No, it's entirely up to us.

18
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,900
I suggest just using Charles Dickens. That's a good idea.

19
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:14,860
Most people have heard of him and have probably read some of his novels or seen films based on them, so that's a good lead into life in his time.

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,320
Exactly, and his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in, don't they?

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,720
He wanted to shock people into doing something about it.

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:33,100
Did he do any campaigning other than writing? Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms and gave talks.

23
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,350
But I'm inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels. Yes, I agree.

24
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,070
Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 25 to 30.

25
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,660
Now listen and answer questions 25 to 30.

26
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,200
OK, so now should we think about a topic linked to each novel?

27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,940
Yes, I've printed out a list of Dickens's novels in the order they were published, in the hope you degree to focus on him.

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:49,680
You're lucky I did agree. Let's have a look OK. The first was the pick Wick papers published in 1836.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,900
It was very successful when it came out, wasn't it? And was adapted for the theater straight away.

30
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:06,040
There's an interesting point, though, that there's a character who keeps falling asleep and that medical condition was named after the book- Pickwickian syndrome.

31
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,860
Oh, so why don't we use that as the topic and include some quotations from the novel. Right! 

32
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,840
Next is Oliver Twist. There's a lot in the novel about poverty, but maybe something less obvious.

33
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,700
Wow, Oliver is taught how to steal, isn't he? We could use that.

34
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:35,320
To illustrate the fact that very few children went to school, particularly not poor children. So they learned in other ways, good idea.

35
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,630
What's next? maybe, Nicholas Nickleby?

36
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,020
Actually, he taught in a really cruel school, didn't he? That's right.

37
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,770
but there's also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins.

38
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,940
We could do something on theaters and other amusements of the time.

39
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
We don't want only the bad things, do we? OK!

40
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,920
What about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, didn't he?

41
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,220
Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before, and drew on his experience there in the novel.

42
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,780
I wonder though, the main theme is selfishness, so we could do something on social justice?

43
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,970
No, too general, let's keep to your idea. I think it would work well.

44
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,200
He wrote Bleak House next. That's my favorite of his novels. Yes, mine too? Oh.

45
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,400
His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful. That's true.

46
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,040
But think about Esther, the heroin as a child. She lives with someone she doesn't know is her aunt, who treats her very badly.

47
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Then she's very happy living with her Guardian, and he puts are in charge of the household.

48
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,230
And at the end she gets married and her Guardian gives her and her husband a house, where of course there very happy. Yes, I like that.

49
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,700
What should we take next?  Little Dorrit.

50
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,240
Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors prison for years, so was Dickens‘s father, wasn't he?.That's right.

51
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:18,700
What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune, and he starts pretending he's always been rich? Good idea.

52
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:26,370
OK, so next we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue. That's going to be quite hard.

53
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,630
That is the end of Part 3.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,410
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 3.
