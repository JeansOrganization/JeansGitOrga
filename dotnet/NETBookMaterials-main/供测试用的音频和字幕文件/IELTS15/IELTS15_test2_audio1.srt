00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,270
Test 2

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,120
This is the IELTS listening test.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,770
You will hear a number of different recordings and you will have to answer questions on what you hear.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,880
There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you will have a chance to check your work.

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,550
All the recordings will be played once only.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,210
The test is in four parts.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,990
At the end of the test you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,370
Not turn to part one.

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,340
Part one

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,220
You will hear a woman calling a tourist information office to ask about her festival.

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,700
First, you have some time to look at questions one to four.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,180
Now listen carefully and answer questions one to four.

13
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,880
Good morning, your through to the tourist information office. Tim speaking. How can I help you?

14
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,320
Oh hello, could you give me some information about next month's festival please?

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,620
My family and I will be staying in the town that week.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,560
Of course, well, it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.

17
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,550
Oh. I heard about that. The orchestra and singers come from the USA, don't they? They are from Canada?

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,360
They're very popular over there.

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,480
They're going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults.

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,520
That sounds good. My whole family are interested in music.

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,500
The next day the 18th. There's a performance by a ballet company called EUSTATIS.

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:22,180
Sorry, the name is spelled EUSTATIS.

23
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,940
They appeared in last year's festival and went down very well.

24
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,440
Again, their program is designed for all ages. Good, I expect we'll go to that.

25
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,260
I hope there's going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:50,940
You're in luck. On the 19th and 20th, a local Amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group. it's called Jemima. That'll be on in the town Hall.

27
00:02:51,100 --> 00:03:02,710
They've already performed it two or three times. I haven't seen it myself, but the review in the local paper was very good. And is it suitable for children? Yes.

28
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,500
In fact, it's aimed more at children than adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,540
And what about dance? Will there be any performances? Yes. Also on the 20th, but in the evening.

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,820
A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces with electronic music by young composes.

31
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:35,060
The show is about how people communicate or failed to communicate with each other, so it's got the rather strange name: Chat.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,080
 I suppose that's because that's something we do both face to face and online. That's right.

33
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,490
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 5 to 10.

34
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,350
Now listen and answer questions 5 to 10.

35
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,380
Now there are also some workshops and other activities. They'll all take place at least once every day.

36
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,440
So everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.

37
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,960
Good, We're particularly interested in cookery. You don't happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?

38
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,120
We suddenly do, it's going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle,

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,720
and it'll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.

40
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,460
That might be worth going to. We're trying to encourage our children to cook.

41
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Another workshop is just for children, and that's on creating posters to reflect the history of the town.

42
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,620
The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people's lives have changed over the centuries.

43
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,070
The results will be exhibited in the Community Center.

44
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,340
Then the other workshop is in toy making, and that's for adults only.

45
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,280
Oh, Why is that? Because it involves carpentry, participants will be making toys out of wood,

46
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,800
so they'll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around it.

47
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,820
Makes sense to keep children away from it exactly.

48
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:57,050
Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities. They'll be supervised wild swimming. wild swimming?

49
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:06,240
What's that? It just means swimming in natural waters rather than a swimming pool. Oh, OK. In a Lake, for instance.

50
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,360
Yes, there's a beautiful one just outside the town, and that will be the venue for the swimming.

51
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,160
They'll be lifeguards on duty, so it's suitable for all ages.

52
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,620
And finally, they'll be a walk in some nearby Woods every day.

53
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:31,440
The leader is an expert on insects. He'll show some that live in the Woods, and how important they are for the environment.

54
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,160
So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival. There certainly are!

55
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,110
If you'd like to read about how the preparations for the festival of going, the festival organizer is keeping a blog.

56
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,140
Just search online for the festival website and you'll find it.

57
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,270
Well. Thank you very much for all the information you're welcome. Goodbye goodbye.

58
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,370
That is the end of part one.

59
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,750
You now have one minute to check your answers to part one.
