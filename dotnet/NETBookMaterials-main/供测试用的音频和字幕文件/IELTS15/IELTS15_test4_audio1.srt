Test 4

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,940
This is the IELTS listening test.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,590
You will hear a number of different recordings and you will have to answer questions on what you hear.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,700
There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you will have a chance to check your work.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,360
All the recordings will be played once only.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,020
The test is in four parts.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,810
At the end of the test you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,190
Now, turn to part one.

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,170
Part one

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,430
You will hear a representative from a train company, talking to a woman about her train journey.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,770
First, you have some time to look at questions one to six.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,240
Now listen carefully and answer questions one to six.

13
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:43,080
Hello, do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today, we're doing a customer satisfaction survey.

14
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,020
Yes, OK. I've got about 10 minutes before my train home leaves. I'm on a day trip.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,540
Great, thank you. So, first of all, could you tell me your name? It's Sophie Bird.

16
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,220
thank you. And would you mind telling me what you do?

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,940
I'm a journalist. Really? That must be interesting.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,240
Yes, it is. So what's the reason for your visit here to the work.

19
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,220
Actually it's my day off. I came here to do some shopping. Oh, right.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:22,480
But I do sometimes come here for work. OK. now, I'd like to ask some questions about your journey today. Is that OK? yes, no problem.

21
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,960
right, So can you tell me which station you're traveling back to? STAUNFIRTH where I live.

22
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:39,770
Uh, can I just check the spelling? STAUNFIRTH, That's right.

23
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,490
And you traveled from there this morning. Yes, OK, good.

24
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,500
Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought? I assume it wasn't a season ticket as you don't travel everyday.

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,140
That's right, no, I just got a normal return ticket.

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't have a railcard, so I didn't get any discount. I keep meaning to get one because it's a lot cheaper.

27
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:13,220
Yes, you deceived 20% on your ticket today, so you paid the full price for your ticket. I paid 23.70 pounds.

28
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,120
OK. Do you think that's good value for money?

29
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,620
Not really, I think it's too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,340
Yes, that's one of the main complaints we get, so you didn't buy your ticket in advance.

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,600
No, I know it's cheaper if you buy a week in advance, but I didn't know I was coming then.

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,580
I know you can't always plan ahead.

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,600
So did you buy it this morning? No, it was yesterday. right. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,430
Well, I do usually,but the ticket office closes early, and I hate using ticket machines.

35
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,440
I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours. There's always a queue for the machines and they're often out of order.

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,180
A lot of customers are seeing the same thing.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,150
So to answer your question, I got an E ticket online.

38
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,490
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 7 to 10.

39
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,340
And  answer questions 7 to 10.

40
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,510
OK, thank you, now. I'd like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey.

41
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,210
So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,560
Well, I like the Wi-Fi on the train. It's improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.

43
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:08,320
That's the first time today anyone's mentioned that. it's good to get some positive feedback on that. And is there anything you weren't satisfied with?

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,580
Well, normally the trains run on time and pretty reliable, but today there was a delay.

45
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,520
The train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.

46
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,980
That down! now, I'd also like to ask about the facilities at the station.

47
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,360
You probably notice that the whole stations been upgraded. What are you most satisfied with?

48
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:42,700
Oh, I think the best thing is that they've improved the amount of information about train times etc. That's given to passengers is much clearer.

49
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:52,500
Before there was only one board, and I couldn't always see it properly, which was frustrating. That's good. And is there anything you're not satisfied with?

50
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:01,810
let's say, I think things have generally improved a lot. The trains are much more modern and I like the new cafe.

51
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,760
But one thing is that there aren't enough places to sit down, especially on the platforms.

52
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,700
OK, so I'll put sitting down. Shall I ask the thing you're least satisfied with? Yes, OK?

53
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:27,220
Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities? We'd like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied, or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, OK?

54
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,350
But what about the parking at the station?

55
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:43,820
Well, to be honest, I don't really have an opinion as I never use it, so neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then. yes, I suppose so. OK, and what about these?

56
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
That is the end of part one.

57
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,370
You now have one minute to check your answers to part one.
