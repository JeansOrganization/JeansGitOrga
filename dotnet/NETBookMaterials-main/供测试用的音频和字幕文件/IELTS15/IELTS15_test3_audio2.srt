Part 2

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,150
You will hear a woman called Alice  Riches, talking on the radio, about a scheme which involves closing streets to traffic to allow children to play.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,270
First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 16.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,150
Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 16.

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,800
My guest on the show today is Alice Riches, who started the street play scheme where she lives in Beachwood Road.

6
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:29,560
For those of you that don't already know, street play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours, so that children have a chance to play in the streets safely.

7
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:41,790
She started it in her own street Beachwood Road, and the idea caught on, and there are now street place games all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?

8
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,760
Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler,

9
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:54,300
so that's about six years ago now, but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.

10
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,860
So the schemes been up and running for three years now.

11
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,100
We'd love to be able to close our road for longer for the whole weekend from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:12,360
At the moment is just once a week, but when we started it was only once a month. But we're working on it.

13
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,940
So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?

14
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:24,290
We have volunteer wardens, mostly parents, but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end.

15
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,440
The council have provided special signs, but there's always a volunteer there to explain what's happening to any motorists.

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Generally they are fine about it. We've only had to get the police involved once or twice.

17
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,970
Now, I should explain that the road isn't completely closed to cars, but only residents cars are allowed.

18
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:56,850
If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road, it's not a problem, as long as they drive at under 20 kilometers per hour.

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,400
But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time.

20
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,500
All they park in another Street. The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.

21
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,080
So can anyone apply to get involved in street play?

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:21,430
Absolutely, we want to include all kids in the city, especially those who live on busy roads. It's here that demand is greatest.

23
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,660
Obviously there isn't such demand in wealthier areas where the children have access to parks or large gardens,

24
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,640
or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.

25
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,900
I'd recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go.

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,920
We've been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city, and that's not just parents.

27
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,410
There are always a few who complain, but they are tiny minority.

28
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:02,010
On the whole, everyone is very supportive and say they're very happy to see children out on the street, even if it does get quite noisy.

29
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,840
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 17 to 20.

30
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,930
Listen and and answer questions 17 to 20.

31
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,500
There have been so many benefits of straight play for the kids.

32
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:52,720
Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they're not doing anything particularly energetic.

33
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,430
And of course, it's great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents.

34
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,770
But for me, the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents.

35
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,980
The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street. It's like having a big extended family.

36
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,400
It certainly does have a lot of benefits. I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.

37
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:40,250
Right, well, this was an experiment I was involved in, where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street, which is the busiest main road in our area, by persuading people not to use their cars for one day.

38
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:53,480
We thought about making people pay more for parking, but we decided that would be really unpopular. So instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street but left the other car parks open.

39
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,430
It was surprising how much of a difference all this made.

40
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:08,490
As we predicted, air quality was significantly better, but what I hadn't expected was how much quieter it would be ,even with the bus is still running.

41
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:20,400
Of course, everyone said they felt safer, but we were actually amazed that Sales  in the shops went up considerably that day. We thought they'd be fewer people out shopping, not more. That's really interesting. So the fact that.

42
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,700
That is the end of Part 2.

43
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,260
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 2.
