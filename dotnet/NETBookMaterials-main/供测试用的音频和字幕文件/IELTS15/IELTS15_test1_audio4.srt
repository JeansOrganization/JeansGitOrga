Part 4

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:10,750
You will hear a student giving a presentation about a type of tree, known as the eucalyptus, which is common in Australia.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

4
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,870
Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

5
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:40,500
Today I'm going to talk about the eucalyptus tree. This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it's also sometimes called the gum tree.

6
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,670
First, I'm going to talk about why it's important, then I'm going to describe some problems it faces at present.

7
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,340
Right, well, the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons.

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:09,710
For example, it gives shelter to creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers.

9
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,310
So it supports biodiversity.

10
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:24,480
It's useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil extracted from Eucalyptus leaves.

11
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,880
The eucalyptus grows all over Australia, and the trees can live for up to 400 years.

12
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:42,920
so it's alarming that all across the country, numbers of Eucalyptus are falling, because the trees are dying off prematurely.

13
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,150
So what are the reasons for this?

14
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,940
One possible reason is disease.

15
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,570
As far back as the 1970s, the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows .

16
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,320
The trees leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die.

17
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:18,220
It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads.

18
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,960
The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.

19
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,880
What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth.

20
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,070
When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.

21
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,110
But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:57,990
By 2000, huge numbers of Eucalyptus Wood dying along Australia's East Coast of a disease known as Bell minor, associated dieback.

23
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:06,320
The Bell Minor is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of Bell minors.

24
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,470
Again, it's the leaves of the trees that are affected.

25
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:25,150
What happens is that insects settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it.

26
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:36,400
The Bell minor birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it.

27
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:47,470
So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.

28
00:04:52,630 --> 00:05:00,560
But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell minor associated die back.

29
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,420
So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation.

30
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,950
One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia.

31
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:26,180
A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson, is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there.

32
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:41,970
If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages grass to grow afterwards, while if the bushfires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.

33
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,500
So why is this?

34
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,530
Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus?

35
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:02,390
Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume water needed by eucalyptus trees.

36
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,300
And there's another reason.

37
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,240
If these other quick growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate,

38
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,660
they harm the Eucalyptus in another way by affecting the composition of the soil and removing nutrients from it.

39
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,810
So some bush fires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive, as long as they are not too frequent.

40
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:41,220
In fact, there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practice regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.

41
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,840
But since Europeans arrived on the continent the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled.

42
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:59,280
Now, scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels has led to what's known as dry rainforest,

43
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,170
which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions.

44
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,860
And what's special about this type of rainforest?

45
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:20,240
Well, unlike tropical rainforest, which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a simple one.

46
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,610
It has very thick dense vegetation, but not much variety of species.

47
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:39,110
The vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the Bell Minor Bird, which builds its nests in the undergrowth there.

48
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,230
But again, that's not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.

49
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,300
That is the end of part 4.

50
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,540
You now have one minute to check your answers to part 4.

51
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,320
That is the end of the listening test.

52
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,300
In the IELTS test, you would now have 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.
