Part 2

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:11,600
You will hear the chair of a committee on park facilities addressing her local town council about changes that have been made to the park.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,510
First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 16.

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,130
Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 16.

5
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,820
As chair of the Town Council subcommittee on park facilities.

6
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,100
I'd like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park.

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,520
So if you could just take a look at the map I handed out, let's begin with a general overview.

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,880
So the basic arrangement of the park hasn't changed.

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,440
It still has two gates, North and South, and a Lake in the middle.

10
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,740
The cafe continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks ,

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,190
and it is still in the same place, looking out over the Lake and next to the Old Museum.

12
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,940
We're hoping to change the location of the toilets, and bring them nearer to the center of the park.

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,360
as there a bit out of the way at present, nearly adventure playground in the corner of your map.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,790
The formal gardens have been replanted, an should be at their best in a month or two.

15
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:13,480
They used to be behind the Old Museum, but we've now used the space near the South Gate, between the park boundary and the path that goes past the Lake towards the Old Museum.

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,460
We have a new outdoor gym for adults and children, which is already proving very popular.

17
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,640
It's by the glass houses just to the right of the path from the South Gate.

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,090
You have to look for it as it's a bit hidden in the trees.

19
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,910
One very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp.

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,660
It's in constant use during the evenings and holidays.

21
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:56,740
It's near the old museum. at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the Lake and the museum.

22
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,420
We've also introduced a new area for wild flowers to attract bees and butterflies.

23
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:14,480
It's on a bend in the path that goes around the East side of the Lake, just south of the adventure playground.

24
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,170
Before you hear the rest of the presentation, you have some time to look at questions 17 to 20.

25
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,350
Now listen and answer questions 17 to 20.

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,530
Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.

27
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,350
One of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground.

28
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,750
We were aware that we had no where for children to let off steam.

29
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:17,890
And decided to use are available funds to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the North of the park.

30
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:26,570
It's open year round, though it closes early in the winter months and entrance is completely free.

31
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,100
Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age.

32
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:44,970
But we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there. There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.

33
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,570
Lastly, the glass houses.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:58,880
A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side.

35
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,770
Over 80,000 pounds were spent on replacing the glass walls, and the metal supports.

36
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:17,850
As well as the plants that had been destroyed, although unfortunately, the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now.

37
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:30,030
At present, the glass houses are open from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Mondays to Thursdays, and it's hoped to extend this to the weekend soon.

38
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,080
We are grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.

39
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,230
The gardens have really been.

40
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,350
That is the end of Part 2.

41
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,890
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 2.
