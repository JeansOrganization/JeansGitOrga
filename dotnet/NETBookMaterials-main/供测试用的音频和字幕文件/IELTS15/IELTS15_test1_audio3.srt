Part 3

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:10,170
You will hear two psychology students discussing the effects of the order in which the children in a family are born.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,910
First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 26.

4
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,980
Now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 26.

5
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,530
Ed.

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,740
How are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:07,460
Well, OK roof, but there's so much of it, I know, I hadn't realized birth order was such a popular area of research,

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,520
but the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:23,160
From what I've been reading, a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determine certain personality traits are just stereotypes, with no robust evidence to support them.

10
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,910
OK, but that's an interesting point.

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,100
We could start by outlining what previous research has shown.

12
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,200
There are studies going back over 100 years.

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:42,840
Yeah, so we could just run through some of the typical traits, like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well adjusted,

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,920
right. But on a positive note, some studies claim that they were thought to be good at nurturing.

16
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,300
Certainly in the past when people had large families, they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,210
There isn't such a clear picture for middle children.

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,480
But one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with an older or younger siblings.

19
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,960
Generally eager to please and helpful, although that certainly not accurate as far as my family goes.

20
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,180
My middle brother was a nightmare, always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,560
As I said, none of this seems to relate to my own experience on the youngest in my family, and I don't recognize myself in any of the studies I've read about.

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:39,100
I'm supposed to have been a sociable and confident child , who made friends easily, but I was actually terribly shy.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,240
Really? that's funny. There have been hundreds of studies on Twins, but mostly about nurture versus nature.

24
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,620
There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in social situations,

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,420
because they always have their twin around to depend on full support.

26
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,100
My cousins were like that when they were small.

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,970
They were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.

28
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,160
They're fine now, though. Only children have had a really bad press.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,900
A lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them, because they've never had to fight for their parents attention.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,030
That does seem a bit harsh.

31
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,300
One category I hadn't considered before was children with much older siblings.

32
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:33,720
A couple of studies mentioned that these children grow up more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves, like getting dressed.

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:43,240
I can see how that might be true, although I expect there sometimes the exact opposite, playing the baby roll and clamoring for special treatment.

34
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,920
Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 27 to 30.

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,540
Now listen and answer questions 27 to 30.

36
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,760
What was the problem with most of these studies? Do you think.

37
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:40,920
I think it was because in a lot of cases, data was collected from only one sibling per family ,who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.

38
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:50,180
Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate, though.

39
00:04:50,540 --> 00:05:00,500
Performances in intelligence tests declined slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings. This has been proved in lots of recent studies.

40
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,920
Yes, Although what many of them didn't take into consideration was family size.

41
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:16,600
the more siblings that are the likely of the family is to have a low socioeconomic status, which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.

42
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,060
the oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.Exactly.

43
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,560
but the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising,I think.

44
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,870
It's not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age, which is what I would have expected.

45
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,680
It's that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings. By verbalizing processes.

46
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:50,820
Right, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contributes in a small way to better performance.

47
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,620
So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?

48
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,100
I think so. My younger brother was incredibly annoying and we thought a lot,

49
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,020
but I think this is made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself.

50
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,430
We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologize to him.

51
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,240
But we had to put up with each other, and most of the time we coexisted amicably enough.

52
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,060
Yes, my situation was pretty similar.

53
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,170
But I don't think having two older brothers made me any less selfish.

54
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,650
I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff. That's perfectly normal.

55
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,820
That is the end of Part 3.

56
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,590
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 3.
