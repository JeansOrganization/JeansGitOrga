Part 4

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,620
You will hear part of a presentation about an agricultural program in the country of Mozambique.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,940
First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

4
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
And carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

5
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:25,850
I'm going to report on a case study of a program, which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique, a largely agricultural country in South East Africa.

6
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:34,420
The program worked with three communities in Chick Kuala Kuala district near the Limpopo River.

7
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,940
This is a dry and arid region with unpredictable rainfall.

8
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,700
Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture,

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,520
and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal.

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:09,830
However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term, as they were rapidly using up this resource.

11
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:27,060
To support agriculture in this dry region, the program focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River, by setting up systems of irrigation,

12
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,830
which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals.

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,600
The program worked closely with the district government, in order to find the best way of implementing this.

14
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:52,460
The region already had one farmers Association and it was decided to set up two more of these.

15
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:03,910
These associations planned and carried out activities, including water management, livestock breeding and agriculture.

16
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,290
And it was notable that in general, women formed the majority of the workforce.

17
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:26,480
It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown.

18
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:37,510
The community was responsible for creating these fences, but the program provided the necessary wire for making them.

19
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,840
Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated.

20
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:57,440
The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the program provided the necessary seeds for this.

21
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:07,820
The program also provided pumps, so that water could be brought from the River in pipes to the fields.

22
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:21,880
However, the labor was all provided by local people, and they also provided and put up the posts that supported the fences around the fields.

23
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,090
Once the program had been set up, its development was monitored carefully.

24
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,780
The farmers were able to grow enough produce, not just for their own needs, but also to sell.

25
00:04:43,040 --> 00:05:03,180
However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not have access to transport, and this resulted in large amounts of produce, especially vegetables being spoiled.

26
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:20,160
This problem was discussed with the farmers associations, and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation.

27
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:31,540
There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned, but which became a central feature of the program.

28
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:45,070
This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced off areas, and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish.

29
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,500
An important source of protein.

30
00:05:49,820 --> 00:06:02,820
After a time another suggestion was made by local people which hadn't been part of the program's original proposal, but which was also adopted later on.

31
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,110
They decided to try setting up colonies of bees.

32
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,860
Which would provide honey, both for their own consumption and to sell.

33
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,410
So what lessons can be learned from this program?

34
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:37,300
First of all, it tells us that in dry arid regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture.

35
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:53,820
In Chick Kuala Kuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income.

36
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:11,750
However, it's important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the program, especially for its design, as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.

37
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:21,290
The program demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas

38
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,490
That is the end of part 4.

39
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,740
You now have one minute to check your answers to part 4.

40
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,520
That is the end of the listening test.

41
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,500
In the IELTS test you would now have 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.
