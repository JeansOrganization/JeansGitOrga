You will hear a woman who works at an employment agency talking to a man about jobs he could apply for.

11
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,000
First, you have some time to look at questions one to five.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,580
Now listen carefully and answer questions one to five.

13
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:41,300
Good morning. Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency . I'm one of the agency representatives and my name is Sally Baker.

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,640
Hi Sally, I think we spoke on the phone didn't we that's right. We did.

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:54,680
So, thank you for sending in your CV, we've had quite a careful look at it and I think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:02,700
OK, the first one, is in a company based in north London, there looking for an administrative assistant, OK.

17
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:09,940
What sort of company is it? They're called home solutions and they design and make furniture?

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh I don't know much about that, but it sounds interesting.

19
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,680
yes. Well, as I said, they want someone in their office and looking at your past experience, it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements.

20
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,020
So on your CV it appears you've done some data entry.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:36,920
Yes, so that's one skill they want. Then they expect the person there point to attend meetings and take notes there OK.

22
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:46,520
I've done that before. Yes, and you need to be able to cope with general admin. Filing and keeping records and so on, but that should be OK.

23
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,920
And in my last job, I also had to manage the diary.

24
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,060
Excellent! That's something they want here too. I'd suggest you add it to your CV.

25
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,860
I don't think you mentioned that. Did you? No.

26
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:07,300
So, as far as the requirements go, they want a good computer skills of course, and they particularly mention spreadsheets.

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,860
That should be fine. And interpersonal skills, which would be something they'd check with your references. I think that should be OK. Yes.

28
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,120
and then they mentioned that they want someone who is careful and takes care with details.

29
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,760
Just looking at your CV, I'd say you're probably all right there, I think so, yes!

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:37,420
Do they want any special experience? I think they wanted some experience of Teleconferencing. Oh, I've got three years experience of that.

31
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:48,460
Uh-huh, let's see, yes. Good. In fact there only asking for at least one year, so that's great. So is that something that might interest you? It is, yes.

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,700
The only thing is you said they were in north London, so it would be quite a long commute for me, OK?

33
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,230
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 6 to 10.

34
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,890
Now listen and answer questions 6 to 10.

35
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,120
So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes at.

36
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:48,200
That's for a warehouse assistant, and that's in south London. Yes, that would be a lot closer,

37
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,640
And you've worked in a warehouse before, haven't you?

38
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:00,720
Yes, so as far as the responsibilities for this position, they want someone who could manage the stock obviously, and also deliveries.

39
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,950
That should be OK. You've got to keep track of stuff, but I've always been quite good with numbers.

40
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:15,410
Good, that their first requirement, and they want someone who is computer literate which we know you are. Sure.

41
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,220
And then they mention organizacional skills. They want someone who's well organized.

42
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:29,360
Yes, I think I am. And tidy? Yes, they go together really, don't they? Sure!

43
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:36,220
then the usual stuff, they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing, OK?

44
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,160
And for the last warehouse job I had, one of the things I enjoyed most was being part of a team.

45
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,840
I found that was really essential for the job.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,200
Excellent, yes, they do mention that they want someone who's used to that, yes?

47
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,720
Now when you were working in a warehouse last time, what sorts of items were you dealing with?

48
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:07,620
It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment, sinks and stoves and fridges. So you're OK moving heavy things?

49
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,920
Sure, I'm quite strong, and I've had the training. Good!

50
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,220
Now. As far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a license,

51
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,680
and that you have experience of driving in London. so you can cope with the traffic and so on.

52
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,940
Yes, no problem. and you've got experience of warehouse work.

53
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:39,610
And the final thing they mention is customer service. I think looking at your CV you're OK there, right? So what about pay? Can you tell me a bit more about that please?

54
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
That is the end of part one.

55
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,270
You now have one minute to check your answers to part one.
