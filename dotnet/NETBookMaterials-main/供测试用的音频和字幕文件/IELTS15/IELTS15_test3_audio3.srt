Part 3

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,640
You will hear two students called Hazel and Tom talking about Hazel's media studies assignment.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,430
First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 26.

4
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,490
Now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 26.

5
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:01,580
Tom, can I ask you for some advice please? Yes, of course, if you think I can help, what's it about?

6
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,480
It's my first media studies assignment. Um, I'm not sure how to go about it.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,220
You must have done it last year. Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?

8
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,080
That's right. Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.

9
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,580
So, what sort of things do I need to compare?well?

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,500
There are several things. For example, there's the question of which page of the newspaper the item appears on.

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,090
You mean because there's a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page 10, for instance. Exactly.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,170
And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,800
Then there's the size. How many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,360
And I suppose that includes the headline. It certainly does. It's all part of attracting the readers attention.

15
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:08,340
What about graphics? Whether there's anything visual in addition to the text. yes, you need to consider those two,

16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,390
because they can have a big effect on the reader's understanding of the story. Sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself.

17
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,650
Then you'll need to look at how the item is put together, what structure is it given?

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:31,490
Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the journalist put at the beginning.

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,820
And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end where people probably won't read it.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,360
And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don't they? Either deliberately or by accident?

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,080
Should I be looking at that too? Yes, if you can.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Compare what's in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what's true and what isn't.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:11,830
And that relates to a very important point: what's the writers purpose? Or at least, the most important one, if they have several.

24
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:23,060
It may seem to be to inform the public, but often is that they want to create fear or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous.

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,310
Gosh, I see what you mean.

26
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,160
And I suppose the writer may make assumptions about the reader.

27
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:41,800
That's right! About their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and the level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronized.

28
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,000
All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,740
Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 27 to 30.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,380
Now listen and answer questions 27 to 30.

31
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
Does it matter what type of story I write about?

32
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:35,880
No, national or international politics, the arts, anything, as long as it's covered in two or three newspapers?

33
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,420
Though of course it will be easier and more fun if it's something you're interested in, and know something about.

34
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:52,490
And on that basis and national news item would be worth analyzing. I'm quite keen on politics, so I'll try and find a suitable topic.

35
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:01,230
What did you choose for your analysis, Tom? I was interested in how newspapers expressed their opinions explicitly.

36
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,480
So I wanted to compare editorials in different papers.

37
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,440
But when I started looking, I couldn't find two on the same topic that I felt like analyzing.

38
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,360
In that case, that won't even bother to look.

39
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,580
So in the end I chose a human interest story.

40
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:30,120
A terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill, and lots of other people, mostly strangers, raised money so she could go abroad for treatment.

41
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:42,800
Actually, I was surprised some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like, why treatment wasn't available here.

42
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,290
I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me.

43
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:57,610
I'll avoid that. Perhaps all choose an arts topic, like different reviews of a film or something about funding for the arts.

44
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,380
I'll think about that. Yes, that might be interesting.

45
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,890
OK, well, thanks a lot for your help Tom. It's been really useful, you're welcome. Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.

46
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,020
That is the end of Part 3.

47
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,790
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 3.
