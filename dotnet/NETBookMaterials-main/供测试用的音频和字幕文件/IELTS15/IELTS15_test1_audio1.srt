00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,940
Published by Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment, English, 2020.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,390
This recording is Copyright.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,790
Test 1

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,830
This is the IELTS listening test.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,470
You will hear a number of different recordings and you will have to answer questions on what you hear.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,580
There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you will have a chance to check your work.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,260
All the recordings will be played once only.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,910
The test is in four parts.

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,690
At the end of the test you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,070
Not turn to part one.

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,050
Part one

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,810
You will hear a woman phoning a friend to get information about a job agency.

14
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,140
First, you have some time to look at questions one to five.

15
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,730
Now listen carefully and answer questions one to five.

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:54,230
Hello William, this is Amber. You said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned.

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:08,250
Is now a good time? Hi Amber. Yes fine, so the agency I was talking about is called Bankside , based in Docklands. I can tell you the address now. 497 East side.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:21,380
OK thanks, so is there anyone in particular I should speak to there? The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson. Let me write that down Becky.

19
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,080
Jamieson, Jamieson

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,790
Do you have her direct line? Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere.

21
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:49,780
Right here we are, 07866510333, I wouldn't call her until the afternoon if I were you. She's always really busy in the morning, trying to fill last minute vacancies.

22
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,540
She's really helpful and friendly, so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they do with, isn't it?

24
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,560
That's right, I know you're hoping to find a full time job in the media eventually,

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:13,340
but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector, which will look good on your CV and generally pays better too.

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,820
Yeah, I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,490
I wouldn't worry. They'll probably start you with a receptionist or something like that. So what's important for that kind of job?

28
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:35,020
Isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems, it's communication that really matters, so you'd be fine there, 

29
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,640
and you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It's not that complicated.

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,420
OK, good.

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:50,200
So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.

32
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,980
That shouldn't be too difficult,

33
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,660
but you're more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended.

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,620
It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.

35
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,620
Right, I've heard the pay isn't too bad, better than working in a shop or a restaurant.

36
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,580
Oh, yes, definitely. The hourly rate is about 10 pounds, 11 if you're lucky.

37
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,700
That's pretty good. I was only expecting to get 8 or £9 an hour.

38
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,200
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 6 to 10.

39
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,060
Now listen and answer questions 6 to 10.

40
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,240
Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?

41
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,200
Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview.

42
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,960
The interview usually takes about an hour, and you should arrange that about a week in advance.

43
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,200
I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work.

44
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I can probably borrow a suit from mum. Good idea. It's better to look too smart than two casual.

45
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,940
Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,280
No, they don't need to see those. I don't think.

47
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,600
what about my passport? Oh yes, they will ask to see that.

48
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:43,840
OK, I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though. It's just a chance for them to build a relationship with you, so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like.

49
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:55,480
So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates fairly basic ones,and they probably won't ask anything too difficult, like, what your plans are for the future.

50
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,360
Hope not. Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency.

51
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:08,240
For example, the interview will be useful, because they'll give you feedback on your performance so you can improve next time.

52
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,480
And I'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.

53
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,140
Exactly. Most temporary jobs aren't advertised

54
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:29,220
And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time. It's much easier than ringing up individual companies. Yes indeed. Well, I think

55
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
That is the end of part one.

56
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,950
You now have one minute to check your answers to part one.
