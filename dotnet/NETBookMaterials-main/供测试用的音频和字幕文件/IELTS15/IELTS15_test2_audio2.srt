00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,000
Part 2

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,300
You will hear part of the talk to a gardening club about a local park.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,090
First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 14.

4
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,870
Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 14.

5
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm very pleased to welcome this evening's guest speaker, Mark Logan, who's going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park.

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,860
Over to you, Mark. Thank you.

7
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm sure you're all familiar with Minster Park.

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:15,980
It's been a feature of the city for well over a century, and has been the responsibility of the City Council for most of that time.

9
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,280
What perhaps isn't so well known is the origin of the park.

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:39,330
Unlike many public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some wasteland, rich people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,230
It was unclear who actually owned the land.

12
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,650
And this wasn't settled until 20 years later, when the council took possession of it.

13
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,500
You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances.

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,680
It's of Diane Gutshof who played a key role in the history of the park.

15
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,020
Once the council had become the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing.

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,420
Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to.

17
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,020
To enjoy the fresh air and natural environment.

18
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,210
Remember, the park is in a densely populated residential area.

19
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:35,160
Diane Gutshof was one of those people, and she organized petitions and demonstrations, which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:48,220
Soon after this, the First World War broke out in 1914, and most of the park was Doug Arpan, planted with vegetables which were sold locally.

21
00:02:49,100 --> 00:03:02,140
At one stage, the army considered taking it over for troop exercises, and got as far as contacting the City Council, then decided the park was too small to be of use.

22
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,810
There were occasional public meetings during the war in an area that had been retained as grass.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,770
After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914.

24
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,030
And continued almost unchanged until recently.

25
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:35,740
Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times, most recently in 2013, though they were revised in 2015 before any work had started.

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,820
The changes finally got going in 2016 and we're finished on schedule last year.

27
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:53,000
Before you hear the rest of the talk, you have some time to look at questions 15 to 20.

28
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,510
Now listen and answer questions 15 to 20.

29
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,100
OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made, and some things that have been retained.

30
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:50,700
If you look at this map, you'll see the familiar outline of the park, with the River forming the northern boundary ,and a gate in each of the other three walls.

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,770
The statue of Diane Gutshof has been moved.

32
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,880
It used to be close to the South Gate.

33
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,850
But it's now immediately to the North of the Lily Pond, almost in the center of the park, which makes it much more visible.

34
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,730
There's a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the riverbank where the path from the East Gate makes a sharp bend.

35
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,930
There are two areas that are particularly intended for children.

36
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:31,210
The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that's between the River, and the path that leads from the pond to the River.

37
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:42,350
Then there's a new maze, a circular series of paths separated by low hedges. That's near the Westgate.

38
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,150
You go North from there towards the River, and then turn left to reach it.

39
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,840
There have been tennis courts in the park for many years, and they've been doubled from 4 to 8.

40
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,550
They're still in the Southwest corner of the park, where there's a right angle bend in the path.

41
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,690
Something else I'd like to mention is the new fitness area.

42
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,930
This is right next to the Lily Pond on the same side as the Westgate.

43
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,710
Now, as you're all gardeners, I'm sure you'll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.

44
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,880
That is the end of Part 2.

45
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,410
You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 2.
