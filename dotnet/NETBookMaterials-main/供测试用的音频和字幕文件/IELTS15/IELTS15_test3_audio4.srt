Part 4

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,750
You will hear part of a lecture on the early history of keeping clean.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,130
First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,890
Now Listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

5
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:22,780
Nowadays we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dish washing and household cleaning, but this is very much a 20th century development.

6
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,740
The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times.

7
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,780
Since water is essential for life, the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties.

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,380
At least that it rinsed mud off their hands.

9
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:51,320
During the excavation of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that soap making was known as early as 2800 BC.

10
00:01:51,460 --> 00:02:00,640
Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay, with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes.

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,280
This is a method of making soap, though there's no reference to the purpose of this material.

12
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,960
The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn't use soap.

13
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,480
Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand at pumice, and ashes.

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:27,930
Then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as Strigil.

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,250
They also used oil mixed with ashes.

16
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,660
Clothes were washed without soap in streams.

17
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,650
The ancient Germans and Gulls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called soap.

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,350
Made of melted animal fat and ashes.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,450
They used this mixture to tint their hair red.

20
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:03,040
Soap got its name according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat.

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,860
Rain washed these deposits along with wood ashes down into the clay soil along the River tiber.

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.

23
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:31,690
As Roman civilization advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman baths supplied with water from their aqueducts was built around 312 BC.

24
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,850
The bugs were luxurious and bathing became very popular.

25
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:47,240
And by the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.

26
00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:03,640
After the fall of Rome in 460, Seven, 80 and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health.

27
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:17,780
This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of disease in the Middle Ages, and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.

28
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,820
Nevertheless, soap making became an established craft in Europe, and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely.

29
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,180
Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with perfume. Apparently for the first time.

30
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:44,600
Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.

31
00:04:45,830 --> 00:05:00,910
A major step toward large scale commercial soap making occured in 1791, when a French chemist Nicholas LeBlanc patented a process for turning salt into soda ash or sodium carbonate.

32
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,670
Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap.

33
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,050
The LeBlanc process yielded quantities of good quality, inexpensive soda dash.

34
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:24,900
Modern soap making was born some 20 years later, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michelle Eugene Chevrolet,

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,440
another French chemist of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids.

36
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,240
His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soap making became a science.

37
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,890
Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.

38
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,200
Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in several countries.

39
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,200
As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity,

40
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,250
a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed.

41
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,360
Soap was then something ordinary people could afford, and cleanliness standards improved.

42
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:23,600
With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing, and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers, by the turn of the 20th century.

43
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,690
That is the end of part 4.

44
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,930
You now have one minute to check your answers to part 4.

45
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,710
That is the end of the listening test.

46
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:44,690
In the IETLS test, you would now have 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the answer sheet.
